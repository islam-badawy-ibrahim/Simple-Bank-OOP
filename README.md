# Bank Management System (C++)

A simple and efficient Bank Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. This project was developed as part of my university coursework at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence.

## Features
- **Account Creation:** Add new customer accounts with unique IDs and initial balances.
- **Deposit & Withdraw:** Perform financial transactions with real-time balance updates.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find any account using its unique ID.
- **Data Display:** View a comprehensive list of all registered bank customers.
- **Validation:** Basic checks for insufficient funds during withdrawals.

## OOP Concepts Applied
- **Classes and Objects:** Encapsulating account data and operations.
- **Encapsulation:** Managing data through setter and getter-style methods.
- **Constructors:** Initializing account objects with default values.
- **Arrays of Objects:** Managing multiple customer accounts efficiently.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like GCC or MinGW).
2. Download the `main.cpp` file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Compile the code: 
   g++ main.cpp -o BankSystem
5. Run the program:
